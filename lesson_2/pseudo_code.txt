  Given a collection of integers called "numbers"

SET iterator = 1
SET saved_number = value within numbers collection at space 1

WHILE iterator <= length of numbers
  SET current_number = value within numbers collection at space "iterator"
  IF saved_number >= current_number
    go to the next iteration
  ELSE
    saved_number = current_number

  iterator = iterator + 1

PRINT saved_number
