# The outermost call is evaluated by determining the result of rps(rps("rock", "paper"), rps("rock", "scissors")) versus rock. In turn that means we need to evaluate the two separate results of rps("rock", "paper") and rps("rock", "scissors") and later combine them by calling rps on their individual results. Those innermost expressions will return "paper" and "rock", respectively. Calling rps on that input will return "paper". Which finally when evaluated against "rock" will return "paper".
